# Check-League-of-Legends-Ranked-Win-Rate

1. Adjust the program with your own API, you can get from the riot games website

2. Copy paste your lobby joined info here (e.g 
P1 has joined the lobby
P2 has joined the lobby
P3 has joined the lobby
P4 has joined the lobby
P5 has joined the lobby
).

3. The program will output these players win rate and the average win rate.

Reflection: Was learning about APIs and created this simple yet useful program.
